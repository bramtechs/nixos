;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a function `epithet-rename-buffer' to rename
;; the current buffer with a descriptive name.  The name suggestion is
;; governed by the `epithet-suggesters' hook variable: each hook
;; should return either a name suggestion or nil, they are called in
;; turn and the first non-nil suggestion is taken.
;;
;; There are currently suggestion functions for eww, info and help
;; buffers.  For eww there are two, in fact, one that suggests the
;; page title and one that suggests the URL (the title is the
;; default).
;;
;; The `epithet-rename-buffer' function can be called interactively or
;; added to appropriate hooks to rename automatically.  If called
;; interactively you can use the universal prefix argument to get a
;; prompt where you can choose a different name, and the suggested
;; name is available as the default value.
